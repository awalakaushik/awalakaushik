# Hi there, I'm Awala, Kaushik Reddy! 👋

I'm a passionate software developer who loves to explore new technologies and solve challenging problems. I specialize in C#.NET, Angular, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JS, and Web APIs. My passion for solving challenging problems has helped me come up with innovative solutions to complex problems.

## 🌱 What I'm passionate about
As much as I love technology, my heart is set on exploring the vast possibilities of quantum computing and blockchain technology. During my free time, I immerse myself in books and other resources to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date on the latest trends in the rapidly evolving fields of computer science. When I'm not geeking out over code, I recharge my batteries with some serious gaming, or head out to the great outdoors for a refreshing hike. Through it all, I remain steadfast in my commitment to exploring the potential applications of these exciting technologies and finding new and innovative ways to apply them in my work.

## 🔭 My hobbies
When I'm not coding, I love to read books and play table tennis. I also have a creative side and enjoy writing poetry, as well as working on my book. Cooking is another passion of mine, and I enjoy experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.

## 🎉 Fun fact about me
Did you know that I once won a regional table tennis tournament in high school? I still enjoy playing the sport and try to play as often as I can.

## 📚 What I'm currently learning
I'm always looking to improve my skills and learn new things. Some of the things I'm currently learning include:

- Advanced React patterns and techniques.
- TypeScript for building scalable and maintainable apps.
- Machine learning with ML.NET and Quantum Computing Fundamentals using Q#.

## 🚀 React Single Page Application
This portfolio has been transformed into a single page application using React. Each section of the portfolio is a React component, and the entire application is rendered using a main `App` component.

## 🧪 Unit and Integration Tests
Unit and integration tests have been added to ensure that everything is working as expected. The tests are written using Jest and React Testing Library.
